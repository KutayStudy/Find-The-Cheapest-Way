# Find-The-Cheapest-Way
A Python tool that reads a grid and three movement‐costs from an input file, then uses DFS with pruning and memoization to compute the lowest‐cost path from any cell in the leftmost column to the rightmost column (where adjacent “sinkholes” dynamically adjust step costs). Outputs the minimum cost and marks the optimal route in an output file.
